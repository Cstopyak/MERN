OOP 

4 pillars of OOP

abstraction - only showing what you need to use

inheritance - taking info from parent class and giving to a child

encapsulation - grouping things - protect variables like private harder to change and public accessible anywhere

polymorphism - take somethign that already exists and be able to modify it to suite our needs
